# Proposed HydroPML-based Rainfall-runoff-inundation Forecasting
Based on the HydroPML technology, an operational flood forecasting system is developed. 
Four main modeling components are included for flood warning systems: (1) data management based on parameterization and calibration, (2) a rainfall-runoff forecasting model based on PaML, (3) a flood inundation model based on hydrodynamic models, and (4) alerts to the affected population.
